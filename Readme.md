### TikTron

Electron desktop tiktok app based on tiktok-scraper npm module

Status: working version

Note: TikTok recently added a new video fetch policy that doesn't allow videos to be seen/embeded on other websites/apps - currently the app is not working, until TikTok changes its policy or releases a new video url which can be embeddable / usable by other apps.

### Run

To run the code follow these 3 steps:

- Clone the repo or download it as a zip
- Run `npm install` to install the dependencies
- Run `npm start` to start the app
